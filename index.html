  <h1>Luca Coakley</h1>

  <hr>

  <h2>Interests and academics </h2>
  <p>I enjoy programing, mountain biking, and reverse engineering (and anything else that involves solving problems).
    <br> I am particularly interested in web development, computer security, and machine learning.
    <br>In my free time, I like to work on personal projects and contribute to open-source software.</p>

  <hr>

  <h2>Goals and people I admire</h2>
  <p>I admire and hope to be like a lot of famous people in the open source community, including Richard Stallman and Linus Torvalds.
    <br> They have made significant contributions to the field of technology and have inspired me to do the same.
    <br> In the future, I hope to attend a prestigious university and earn a degree in computer science or a related field.
    <br> My ultimate goal is to work for a company that is making a positive impact in the world.
    <br>I also hope to have some sort of tech-related job or internship by the time I start high school to gain experience and skills in the field.</p>

  <hr>
<h2>Accomplishments/projects</h2>
<p>I have completed numerous projects and will release them at the appropriate time.<br> Some notable examples include a C++ library for communicating with Discord webhooks and an ESP32 project that enables it to function as a USB webcam.</p>
